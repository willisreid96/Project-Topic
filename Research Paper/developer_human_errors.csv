 For a more long-term solution, we can generate a C# file at build time,
 say BuildInformation.cs or something which provides the preferred VS
 version (according to the VS action used by Premake). We can also store
 extra data in the future like the Git revisions for C++#, LLVM and Clang to
 aid troubleshooting issues.

The weird thing is that it only occurs with one of my test apps; not the others.
So I'm not sure the cause yet.  I'll be making a repo for the test app soon as it is related to that other project that is on Google docs -- I just haven't had time to clean it up and remove all my ""extra"" test stuff from the source code since I want that repo to be as clean as possible for new developers.
I have downloaded the new Geny, but I haven't installed it.   Too many projects going and not enough time.
Don't close this issue; it is still occurring; just not sure why as I tried to take the same app that you use and make changes to make it have the same number of fields, opening dialogs, etc.  Hmm, it just dawned on me of one change; I do have a custom fonts in this project -- I'll have to see if rendering a custom font has something to do with the issue...",Lapse,L04,Working With Outdated Source Code

Sorry I didn't get around to merging in these changes earlier. There have been some changes made from the LL-HLS work. Please rebase or merge the changes from video-dev:feature/v1.0.0  into your branch.
I never received a response to the request for a sample stream, so if I don't hear back, I'll be going with @victor-at-work's contribution and then work on getting those changes merged into v1 from master rather than this PR - provided everything checks out in terms of feature comparison with Safari <video src=''> playback and testing.

So, texture filtering is set to 0604.  We don't expect this value.
Currently we support the lower value (4) being from 0 - 7.  This is the min value (used when sampling the texture to a smaller area.)
The upper value (6), we treat odd values as linear filtering, and even values as nearest.  We ignore any value like 6.  However, if we did support 6, it would still be nearest, but it would filter between the nearest two mipmap levels I guess.
Does this value vary when linear filtering is working / is not working?  Or is it always 0604 or etc. when things that ought to be filtered are drawn?
Maybe the PSP treats any none zero value in the upper slot as linear.

A solution (I think) would be handling the type of the video being saved (movie or episode) and, in the case of it being a Movie, do something (that I don't know) to create the ViewingStatus without accessing the TvShow show property.

HE_046,Issue,https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1646#issuecomment-537552974,"Well, fair point. I'd reported issues just like this myself.
The bitter truth is: you have to rely on your system package manager, and just keep /usr/local empty. The best make uninstall is rm -rf /usr/local/*. The more permanent stuff you keep alive under /usr/local, the more PITA you'll have with it in the long run. (However, /usr/local shines in playground-style experiments.)
Worse; you can't trust package authors to do uninstall properly. That is another reason why package managers exist; so that we have this epic bug occur exactly once, and learn from the lesson. In that bug, an author rolled his own uninstall script, and made a fatal typo rm -rf /usr /lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg -- spot the extra space.
Sure, we'll fix this in Guake. But many more other projects won't. Many projects don't even offer make uninstall -- correctly delegating that function to package managers.

HE_055,Issue,https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37144#issuecomment-586657626,"I will elaborate on the reason I opened that issue. I've used go doc time and picked time.Tick() for a client connection handler that should free the timer after the client has been disconnected and I assumed that it will free it automatically. It was a rookie mistake and from now on I use go doc -all <pkg> | less, instead. If the function name was TickForever(), I might have given it more thought.
I was convinced that I am not the only one who made that mistake or just read convenience wrapper and did not read further. So I have searched GitHub and googled for code that uses time.Tick() and sure enough I found some cases.
Here is a list of examples, which I believe are problematic, since there is an option to stop or break the loop, yet the ticker cannot be freed:

https://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/windows/svc/example/service.go#L23
https://github.com/Netflix/hal-9001/blob/master/hal/periodic.go#L134
https://github.com/pydio/cells/blob/master/common/service/utils.go#L28

https://github.com/rs/xstats/blob/master/statsd/statsd.go#L79
https://github.com/flynn/flynn/blob/master/controller/scheduler/discoverd.go#L32

Cases that are not problematic, since the executable will exit and the runtime will stop the timer eventually, but are still misused and leak resources:

https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/storage/client_raft_test.go#L1390 (do their leaktest even work?)

The race I'm talking about is between the screenshot action and cleaning up. Something like:
nightmare.on('end', function() {
  const buf = nightmare.screenshot()

})

await nightmare.end()
Without coordination, nightmare.end() may kill the process before the screenshot has finished writing.
Given that you're using tape, I'd probably create a small helper function. I'm not too familiar with tape, so this might be a bit off but something like this:
const Nightmare = require('nightmare')
const assert = require('assert')

// your tests
function TestGoto(tape) {
  test(tape, async nightmare => {
    await nightmare.goto('https://google.com')
    assert.equal('Google', await nightmare.title())
  })
}

// test helper
async function test(tape, fn) {
  const nightmare = Nightmare({ show: false })
  let err

  // don't let failed assertion kill the node process
  try {
    await fn(nightmare)
  } catch (e) {

TypeScript rewriting module identifiers is a slippery slippery slope.  What has been expressed multiple times in this thread is that TypeScript is configurable to model the behaviour of other module resolvers and other build tools, not replace or implement them.
Just because TypeScript can be configured to resolve modules in flexible ways doesn't not mean that TypeScript emits ""broken code"".  Certain loaders and bundlers that mirror this configuration would work just fine.
If we were to be critical of anything, we could blame the team for naming the option something that might look like it fixes a problem it was never intended to fix, though the documentation for the option makes it clear that it does not change the emit.

Apologize for the delay responding. Drugbank DOES indeed have a lic model for commercial usage. https://www.drugbankplus.com has the lic details and contact info. I have no idea what the cost would be... (Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with them, nor am I a lawyer). What I do really like is the data :) which in healthcare IT is somewhat spendy (as you may well know)!
One downside - the data is provided in an enormous XML file, 580+MB. Each drug's data is heavily nested... Let's just say that multi-threading the load isn't planned.
Another idea I had while reviewing the data was to provide the Provider (odd phrase, please forgive me) the ability to print out a PT usage sheet since that is also doable.
Modeling -
I love the UML, but nothing close to the extreme. One thing I really value is the code generation part :)

@MatthewVita

Is there a webpage on this? Can't find anything on it. Seems interesting!

I could have better stated the concept. The more proper term is factory pattern and in my world the concrete implementation is the entity, but this isn't canonical in the development world. It was proposed by the GoF way back in the day in the hallowed tome of 'Design Patterns' for some light reading. I usually follow the abstract factory pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) for something like this. The basic idea is to provide the ability to (in the abstract) support multiple datasets through a single common interface. So - drugbank initially since it's free, and whatever next. From the end user perspective to get the entity ou just say something like
Drug drug = new DrugFactory(""drugbank""); // or whatever ArrayList<String> searchResults = drug.searchByName('Haldol'); //flexible and fun! 
And the factory supplies you the concrete class. With drug, I can use the same methods as with any other concrete drug class - and expect the same results. The key being here is that Drug is an interface which forms the contract - it outlines the public methods the concrete class supply as well as the return. The concrete class implements the interface and no troubles no bubbles. I'll stop here....

OpenEMR uses MySQL and I would bet most users won't be on 5.7 with the native JSON support.

Excellent point. It would make the UI a little more fun. I was thinking we could chuck back JSON to the UI and then use data binding, yet after thinking more about that it opens a can of worms.

There are a few ways. I would recommend putting together a PR and using markdown comments. If you need to visualize things, maybe try out the FOSS http://pencil.evolus.vn/

I'll check out Pencil.... I'm very visual, and also lazy I hope it can generate code ;)
Lastly,
-- Progress, I've been getting up to speed on doctrine. I like it alot! This however introduces a problem with the massive data load, this load isn't viable in browser and will need to be CLI. I couldn't get this functional with the existing framework and rigged up the loader. I'm not sure if this creates a technical debt.
--- I have something approaching a working MVP now regarding initial drug load into a set of tables I'm calling 'KB_Drug_(DOMAIN)'
--- Not that this has to be addressed now, but does anyone have any thoughts on isolating the KB tables into a separate database, schema, or just throw it all together?
-- I'll post my crummy schema and with luck some use cases/domain concepts for comment later today/tonight.",Mistake,M07,Time Management Errors

HE_099,Issue,https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive/issues/185#issuecomment-401572501,"@seriousme Sorry I am late to the thread (and it's already been closed). If anything, the Algorithm Archive is closer to Numerical Recipes than Rosetta Code. I am fully aware both of these projects exist and are similar in scope to the Algorithm Archive; however, we are providing something new here that no other project provides (so far as I'm aware).
Differences from Rosetta Code:

This is fundamentally a book on algorithms, focusing on understanding the underlying algorithms. The goal here is to provide a reading experience that allows users to fully implement and understand every algorithm from the ground-up in the language of their choice. It is definitely not a collection of tasks for the community to complete.
The implementations provided here are also meant for understanding and we will always try to only merge code that can be understood completely. Sure, we are lacking the power to review certain languages, but I have no doubt people will come in to do just that.
We have the goal of providing a full curriculum for different areas of computer science, mathematics, physics, etc. This would mean that anyone wanting to learn the ropes in computational physics (for example) can read our volume on computational physics, and they should be able to fully understand that area of research.

Differences from Numerical Recipes:

First and foremost, our licensing for the code snippets is actually somewhat sane.
This text (in principle) has both a broader scope and expects less background knowledge from the reader. Obviously, we are not there yet on either of those goals, but I are doing what I can to get there.
This text is also (in principle) more of a modern take on the algorithms. Though NR has obviously been updated since 1986, it is showing it's age.

To be clear: I am not against either project. They are both wonderful resources. This book is targeted at a fundamentally different audience than NR (We want people who would watch a youtube video and think, ""Oh man. I want to do that!"" -- basically hobby programmers), but also attempts to provide clear descriptions of the algorithms so people don't need to collate papers and resources from other places.
The tagline, ""A book on every algorithm in existence in every language possible"" is not incorrect. I am sure with time it will become more obvious what the differences are because we are only just now getting started.
Let me know if you have any further questions here. I know that the scope seems similar in nature, but I can assure you we looked at Rosetta Code before starting this project.",Mistake,M07,Time Management Errors

Thanks for reaching out – sorry this took a few days to bubble up to the top after the long weekend.
We use the data that VS Code gathers to provide and improve the product.  For example, in the past, we’ve used the data we collected to isolate several hard to track down sources of crashes and performance regressions.   VS Code may use the hashed MAC address to identify a machine over time.  For example, we may use the hashed MAC address to identify a particular machine experiencing an unusually high number of crashes (which would skew our crash result information).  You are right that we could correlate a machine across data streams, but that’s not how we use it -- we use the unique system information to connect things like crash reports with feature use.
When we first launched VS Code we didn’t allow people to opt out of this collection of data because it was a pre-release product and we were trying to understand if the product was actually useful and had the right mix of features.  As a fully released and supported product from Microsoft, we now let users opt out of providing data -- if users don’t want to provide us with data, then they can opt out but we really appreciate it when we do receive the telemetry as it helps improve the product for all.  That’s said, we want to ensure users have adequate control.
I’d be happy to chat with you on this issue and the points you raise.  I think the easiest way to do that is to connect on email/skype/hangout … I’m smcbreen@microsoft.com.

Some of this, such as the reboot button being a split dropdown like the system overview, could be deferred to another PR. But this PR should have much of the general flow in the wireframe.
Important parts:

Let people know what's up as soon as possible. They should expect that their system may need to be rebooted and that services might need to be restarted. We should have a quick and dirty check that gets this mostly correct, but might be wrong. Hence may. Having it all the time  (whenever updates are available) would be bad, however, as people will just ignore it. So it should be based on some sort of heuristics.
Show the updates as they happen. (We have this already, even in master.)
Provide feedback when the system is doing something, such as checking to see if services need restarting and/or the system needs rebooting. We currently do not do this in the PR. It's absolutely mandatory to have this step.
Have three states at the end:

Updated (and doesn't need intervention). In-page design, like in Cockpit currently.
Services need restarting. A dialog with a simple list of services that need to be restarted, with all checked by default.
System needs a reboot — with a button to reboot the machine. In-page design, like in Cockpit currently.

Ideally with a split button like overview. But that can be a future PR.
Minimally, the action needs to exist, so a simple button should be enough.
We could do the reboot / ignore pattern, but switch ignore to manage services, which would then show the services need restarting dialog. But we'd need to keep the system needs rebooting state with an action button, perhaps in a banner or alert in the software page and in the overview. Or we could make it a top-level shell thing (in another PR).





I've bolded things which do not currently exist in the PR, at least from what I saw earlier today.

Sorry for not replying. I'm afraid I still don't quite follow you, so let me try and work it out. First off, I guess you meant to have impl<T>, like so, and probably Fn<(&'a u32,)>:
impl<T> Foo for Option<T> where
    for<'a> T: Fn<(&'a u32,)>,
    for<'a> <T as Fn<(&'a u32,)>>::Output: Sized
{}

// evaluate <Option<_> as Foo>
I'm not quite sure what the last line means, but if we were to follow the model of the original problem, we'd start with something to prove like for<'a> Option<&'a X>: Foo. ""Opening"" the for and matching this against the impl yields:
Option<$T> = Option<&'0 X>

and hence T = &'0 X. This suggests that we would translate the where clauses on the impl to:
for<'a> &'0 X: Fn<(&'a u32,)>
for<'a> <&'0 X as Fn<(&'a u32,)>>::Output: Sized

which we would could then cover back up as:
for<'a, 'b> &'b X: Fn<(&'a u32,)>
for<'a, 'b> <&'b X as Fn<(&'a u32,)>>::Output: Sized

This all seems...OK. Ah, wait, I guess your point is that we would need to normalize the <&'b X as Fn<(&'a u32,)>>::Output. I feel like we have issues normalizing under for binders still, right?",Mistake,M10,Code Complexity Errors

I just learned about that moments before submitting the PR, sorry. It's still not obvious to me how to fix some of them.
I can conclude that it's not cool to return an array, but I was gonna use an out= parameter anyway, so that's that. But what's with the RefNannyDeclarations that make all the lines where I declare a function go yellow?
Should I aim for no yellow at all?

The charset parameter is only defined for documents of type text/*. That does not apply to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Therefore, sending charset would be a specification violation.
Our behaviour is consistent with the W3C HTML5 specification, which says the following:

If the form element has an accept-charset attribute, let the selected character encoding be the result of picking an encoding for the form.
Otherwise, if the form element has no accept-charset attribute, but the document's character encoding is an ASCII-compatible character encoding, then that is the selected character encoding.
Otherwise, let the selected character encoding be UTF-8.

We can't do either of the first two things because we don't know what the document or form looks like, so we can only do the third. If the user wants a different behaviour (per the first two points) they are required to do it themselves.

I think, as you are realizing, what started as a solution for tedious error handling is trying to become a general purpose construct.  It might be trying to do too much.  But I'll humor you and assume it makes sense to do this route. (Ironically, even though @networkimprov doesn't like this proposal, his comment helped me conceptualize what you are trying to do.)
If the break condition includes a variable comparison, it evaluates when the variable changes. If the condition contains a function call it is also evaluates on every assignment, every control structure condition evaluation and upon every return from a func call, but only once if the return is also an assignment or a control structure condition evaluation.
And if the condition is time consuming then you should restructure your code so that you do not use a time consuming condition with this construct. Instead, use an if statement where you want to evaluate it.",Slip,S03,Multitasking Errors
