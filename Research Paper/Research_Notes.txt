### Goal:
, we propose a new approach to code generation by
LLMs, which we call AlphaCodium - a test-based, multistage, code-oriented iterative flow, that improves the performances of LLMs on code problems


### TEST METHODOLOGY:
We tested AlphaCodium
on a challenging code generation dataset called CodeContests, which includes competitive programming problems
from platforms such as Codeforces. The proposed flow consistently and significantly improves results
